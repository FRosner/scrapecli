  # Useful if you want to delay the creation of the tag in the remote.
  # You can create the tag locally, but not push it, and run GoReleaser.
  # It'll then set the `target_commitish` portion of the release to the value
  # of this field.
  # Only works on GitHub.

  # You can disable GitHub release creation by setting this to true.
  disable: false
  
  # Set this to true if you want to disable just the artifact upload to the
  # GitHub release. This is useful if you want to publish to somewhere else
  # and also GitHub, but don't want to upload the same artifacts twice.
